# mazesolver
This project implements a random maze generator and pathfinding algorithm. It constructs a maze filled with walls, placing the entrance on the left and the exit on the right, with one valid path between them. The algorithm marks cells as VISITED and backtracks at dead ends, ultimately highlighting the final path from the entrance to the exit.
